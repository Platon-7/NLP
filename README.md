# NLP

Natural Language Processing is a Master's course taught at AUEB. During my final year of studies after consulting the teacher of the course,
we decided since I was intrigued by the topic, I should take the course unofficially. These are the group projects that are required by the
course. I had to do them individually since I wasn't officially a student of the program. The students had to choose either Sentiment
Analysis or Part of Speech Tagging and implement their choice with:
1. Logistic Regression, KNN  *only for those who chose Sentiment Analysis*
2. MLP
3. RNN
4. CNN
5. Pretrained BERT

Eventually I ended up doing both, so I have added both projects to this repository. Lastly, I should note that it is possible that the performance
of the models can be improved easily in numerous cases, but I did not have the time for additional fine tuning. After all my main goal was to refresh
some of these methods and learn others from scratch. 
I encourage you to grab the code and perfect those models!
